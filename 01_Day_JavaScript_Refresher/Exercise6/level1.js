// Print the price of each product using forEach

// Print the product items as follows using forEach

// The price of banana is 3 euros.
// The price of mango is 6 euros.
// The price of potato is unknown.
// The price of avocado is 8 euros.

// The price of tea is unknown.
// Calculate the sum of all the prices using forEach

// Create an array of prices using map and store it in a variable prices

// Filter products with prices

// Use method chaining to get the sum of the prices(map, filter, reduce)

// Calculate the sum of all the prices using reduce only

// Find the first product which doesn't have a price value

// Find the index of the first product which does not have price value

// Check if some products do not have a price value

// Check if all the products have price value

// Explain the difference between forEach, map, filter and reduce

// Explain the difference between filter, find and findIndex

// Explain the difference between some and every
